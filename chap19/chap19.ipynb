            "Welcome to TechNews Briefing. It's Wednesday, November 29th. I'm Julie Chang for The Wall Street Journal. With holiday shopping in full force, one place you could turn to for gift ideas is generative AI chatbots like Chachipiti or Google's BARD. Cordelia James from our personal tech team will join us later in the show to discuss how to use AI to make your shopping list. Just be sure to check it twice. But first, starting with some headlines. Adobe's $20 billion acquisition of collaboration software Figma is in trouble. The UK Competition and Markets Authority said Tuesday it has provisionally found the deal would likely harm innovation by eliminating competition between two main companies in product design software. An Adobe spokesperson said the company disagrees with the CMA's perspective and that the company will re-engage with the regulator on the case. Figma also said it disagrees with the CMA's findings and that it remains committed to the deal. The regulator said it would listen to further views from interested parties before making a final decision. A federal judge has temporarily blocked Champeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, from leaving the U.S. Zhao stepped down as CEO last week after pleading guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering requirements. A judge still needs to decide whether he will be required to remain in the country ahead of a February sentencing. Zhao and his attorneys argued he should be allowed to return to his residence in the United Arab Emirates, but the government opposed that, saying Zhao could be a flight risk. And a pile of government money from last year's Inflation Reduction Act was supposed to fuel a wave of clean energy startups. Instead, many of those companies are running out of cash before funding comes through. That's because higher interest rates and rising costs have hurt the startups that are often in capital-intensive industries. Our climate finance reporter Amrit Ramkumar says that means those federal dollars will flow to big companies who can afford to stay afloat without the funding, instead of minting a generation of startups. Some of the startups are in catch-22 scenarios with the government, where basically they're in talks with the DOE loan programs office at the Department of Energy to receive funding. But to receive that money, they have to raise outside cash, they have to show progress on their facility, and that they can repay that government taxpayer loan. And a lot of them are struggling because the funding they need, they can't get because they're burning through their cash and costs are too high for those initial facilities. So we've seen that with the battery recycling startup Y-Cycle, which said that they're pausing construction on a facility in Rochester, and it's unclear what will happen with a $375 million loan agreement. And there are other startups in the space as well in a similar dynamic, like the hydrogen producer Plug Power. And we've already seen a lot of electric vehicle startups either file for bankruptcy or become in danger of doing so. And that bankruptcy filed list includes Wardstown Motors, Proterra, and many others could join Coming up, not sure what to get that one friend or family member with really picky or niche taste? Maybe a chatbot could help. More on that after the break. Let's put out this campfire. Dad, Smoky Bear said to drown it with water, then stir it with a shovel and repeat until cool. Wow. Where can I learn all this? SmokyBear.com because only you can prevent wildfires brought to you by the USDA Forest Service, your state forester and the Ed Council. The holiday shopping season is upon us. And if you're struggling to come up with gift ideas for your loved ones, one place you could turn to is Generative Artificial Intelligence chatbots. According to a September analytics survey by Adobe, one in three people have said they plan to use ChatGPT or some other generative AI tool while holiday shopping this year. Cordelia James from our personal tech team has been looking into this and is back with us now for part three of our special AI gift series. If you haven't heard parts one and two, you can find them on our feed. Let's look for the last two Wednesday episodes. So Cordelia, many people have heard of ChatGPT and other similar generative AI chatbots by now. What are some ways you can use these to shop? So the typical chatbots that we've seen so popular over the past year are definitely useful for product recommendations or like summarizing product reviews. So if you want to get something for yourself or a loved one, but you're not sure where to start, these products can definitely offer some suggestions based on what it finds across the web. So for example, if I were to ask the chatbot, should I buy the AirPods Pro or like the latest AirPods Pro, it can run down like a list of pros and cons, like why should I want it, why I might want to hold back or maybe why I might want to consider a different product instead, as well as recommend some alternatives if there are specific needs, maybe like a budget that I want to stick to. And summarizing even what people say about the product online is super helpful information to get from these bots. What about the retail companies themselves? How are they using generative AI? A lot of these retail companies are forming their own chatbot search combinations. So with companies such as like Shopify and Microsoft Copilot, they've recently started launching these chatbots where as you're speaking to it, it's organizing a bunch of the deals or products that are out there with just different retailers and companies all over the web. So it should be an easier way for you to find deals or compare prices or just to have this chatbot guide you through the shopping process. And more broadly speaking, were there other generative AI tools that you found while you were researching this topic? Yeah, so of course this is only the beginning of us seeing a lot of generative AI in the shopping experience, but there's a lot more things coming. So something that I'm really excited about is this new apparel focus tool that Google plans on rolling out in search labs. Essentially, if you're thinking of some kind of product that you want, but you're not sure if it exists, like let's say maybe a teal and gray colored sweater of some sort, you can run it through this AI image generator and see some pictures that might be what you're thinking of. And then Google will surface different products online that actually match or are somewhat close to what it is that you're looking for. So it's really exciting to see some of the new ways that we might see generative AI in our shopping experience. Shoppers can expect Google's AI image generator shopping tool in December. So Cordelia, you've been testing out all these different tools. How good or useful would you say they are? So all these newer products that these companies are like rolling out, testing, trying to make your life easier with shopping, they aren't perfect just yet. So with a lot of these different tools in with the big chatbots themselves, hallucinations still get in the way sometimes. So if you're trying to, let's say, look for deals on something, you know, sometimes these chatbots will either recommend products to you that are kind of outdated, or maybe a deal that they say exists no longer exists. So it's really hard for it to keep up with everything. So definitely take things with a grain of salt, double check the retailer's website yourself to make sure that you're getting the best deal. But also feel free to play around with some of these tools because you might end up finding products that are useful to you in some way. Since you mentioned hallucinations, did you run into any of them while looking into those Apple AirPods Pro? Yeah, when it comes to like hallucinations, you know, I'll list out some of the features that the AirPods Pro has. And most of them are right, but it could just like mix up something that, let's say, the latest version of AirPods Pro has, like, you know, adaptive audio, or like just conversation awareness. So those are some of the features they can use. But if it confuses one of the earlier generations for having those features, little things like that are possible. So it definitely gives you like a good place to start when you're trying to figure out what you get, what you do not. But still be wary as you're using these tools, because sometimes it's a hit or miss. That was Cordelia James from our personal tech team. And that's it for Tech News Briefing. Today's show was produced by me, Julie Chang, with supervising producer Melanie Roy, and additional support from Anthony Bansi. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.\n"

            "We are on Thursday, November 23, 2023. Welcome to our weekly news show, The News in Slow French. Hello everyone. Hello Arnaud. Hello Catherine. Hello to all our listeners. We will start our show with a discussion about the application of sanctions on Russian oil workers sailing in the Baltic Sea. Then we will talk about events organized in France on the occasion of the release of the Hollywood epic Napoleon. Our subject of scientific discussion of the week will then focus on a study that reveals that magicians are less subject to personality disorders than other artists. And to conclude this first part of the show, we will talk about the new Beaujolais 2023, which is available worldwide. The film Napoleon is a hit. I hope its release will be an opportunity to address Napoleon's controversial history and to discuss his legacy. Have you already seen it? Are you kidding Catherine? You and I, we are not ready to get tickets right away. It's true, but let's continue our announcements. What will we talk about in the second part of the show, Trending in France? We will talk about the laureates of a somewhat special prize, that of the ugly France. The goal is not to criticize these places, but to show what is wrong with their urban landscapes and to encourage improvements. And finally, we will discuss the reissue of the album Random Access Memories by Daft Punk on the occasion of its 10th anniversary in a version without percussion. Excellent, I can't wait to discuss all these topics. Well, in that case, let's not wait any longer. Let's start the show! Is Denmark going to be in charge of blocking Russian oil maritime exports? On November 15, the Financial Times published an article indicating that Denmark could be responsible for inspecting and blocking, if necessary, the cargoes carrying Russian oil sailing in these waters. According to this article, the goal would be to respect the $ 60 ceiling, the barrel, imposed on Russia as part of the sanctions related to the war in Ukraine. The EU officials admit that the ceiling of prices does not work. Many oil companies use forged documents to avoid mandatory Western insurance. The poor condition of cargoes associated with the lack of adequate insurance coverage could have devastating consequences in the event of a black tide. Denmark would have been sued for a third of Russian oil exports by sea passing through its waters. However, according to the Reuters agency, EU diplomats who know the new sanctions proposed by the European Commission have denied the existence of such a proposal. In addition, maritime law experts claim that blocking commercial ships in the Danish Straits would be contrary to international rules, in particular to the United Nations Convention on the Right of the Sea. Why would this violate the right of the sea? Do coastal states not have the right to control their waters and to block ships that do not have appropriate insurance or that risk causing an environmental disaster? According to experts, Denmark would only have the right to block a ship if it represented an obvious threat. OK, but what about sanctions? Is it completely illogical to impose sanctions if they are not applied? Don't you think? I agree, but even if this measure were actually put in place, it would not necessarily be a good solution. I'm afraid so. Some defense experts even say that it would be unprecedented. But Denmark has the right to require documents in good and good shape, doesn't it? Arnaud, Denmark does not systematically verify the papers of ships passing through the Straits, nor inspect them, except when it is a matter of security. It would be difficult for Danish coast guards to implement such a systematic control. And for the NATO Navy? Can you imagine the NATO Navy blocking commercial traffic in the Danish Straits? It would be practically a declaration of war. For more UN videos visit www.un.org\n"
